# Image processing experiments

This repository contains multiple implementations of the same program that manipulates images.

The program does the following things:

1. Read in an image as the first arg passed to it on the command line.
2. Print the filename, width and height to the console.
3. Display the original image and a blurred version of the image.
4. Convert the image to grayscale and save it as `gray-IMAGENAME`
